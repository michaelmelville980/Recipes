        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich layers of flavor and comforting warmth. Made by stacking wide, flat pasta sheets between hearty meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and melty cheese, lasagna is baked until golden and bubbling. Its savory layers create a perfect balance of textures — from tender noodles to gooey mozzarella and perfectly browned edges. Often served as a main course, lasagna is a crowd-pleaser at family dinners, holidays, and potlucks, with endless variations that include vegetables, ricotta, or even plant-based alternatives. It's a timeless favorite that brings people together over every cheesy, satisfying bite.
